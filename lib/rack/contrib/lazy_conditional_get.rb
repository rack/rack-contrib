module Rack

  ##
  # This middleware is like Rack::ConditionalGet except that it does
  # not have to go down the rack stack and build the resource to check
  # the modification date or the ETag.
  #
  # Instead it makes the assumption that only non-reading requests can 
  # potentially change the content, meaning any request which is not 
  # GET or HEAD. Each time you make one of these request, the date is cached
  # and any resource is considered identical until the next non-reading request.
  #
  # Basically you use it this way:
  #
  # ``` ruby
  # use Rack::LazyConditionalGet
  # ```
  #
  # Although if you have multiple instances, it is better to use something like 
  # memcached. An argument can be passed to give the cache object. By default
  # it is just a Hash. But it can take other objects, including objects which
  # respond to `:get` and `:set`. Here is how you would use it with Dalli.
  #
  # ``` Ruby
  # dalli_client = Dalli::Client.new
  # use Rack::LazyConditionalGet, dalli_client
  # ```
  #
  # By default, the middleware only delegates to Rack::ConditionalGet to avoid
  # any unwanted behaviour. You have to set a header to any resource which you 
  # want to be cached. And it will be cached until the next "potential update" 
  # of your site, that is whenever the next POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE request 
  # is received.
  #
  # The header is `Rack-Lazy-Conditional-Get`. You have to set it to 'yes'
  # if you want the middleware to set `Last-Modified` for you.
  #
  # Bear in mind that if you set `Last-Modified` as well, the middleware will 
  # not change it.
  #
  # Regarding the POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE... requests, they will always reset your 
  # global modification date. But if you have one of these request and you 
  # know for sure that it does not modify the cached content, you can set the
  # `Rack-Lazy-Conditional-Get` on response to `skip`. This will not update the
  # global modification date.

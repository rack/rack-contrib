module Rack

  # The Rack::TryStatic middleware delegates requests to Rack::Static middleware
  # trying to match a static file
  #
  # Examples
  #
  # use Rack::TryStatic,
  #   :root => "public",  # static files root dir
  #   :urls => %w[/],     # match all requests
  #   :try => ['.html', 'index.html', '/index.html'] # try these postfixes sequentially
  #
  #   uses same options as Rack::Static with extra :try option which is an array
  #   of postfixes to find desired file
